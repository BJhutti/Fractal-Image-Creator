# Fractal-Image-Creator

This program generates a Mandlebrot and Julia fractal image based on the given attributes in the Main function. These images are viewable using Gimp.
A class for pixels, imaginary numbers, and the fractals themselves were needed, and I had a lot of fun integrating them together.
