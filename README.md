# Fractal-Image-Creator

## A application created for my CMPT 1209 course at Douglas College

This program generates a Mandlebrot and Julia fractal image based on the given attributes in the Main function. These images are viewable using Gimp.
A class for pixels, imaginary numbers, and the fractals themselves were needed, and I had a lot of fun integrating them together.

I recieved an A+ for this project! I was very proud of how it turned out.
